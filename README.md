Introduction


CEAPS website contains the public expenditures of Senators from Brazil, saved by year. Through these files, it is possible to gain better insight into where a portion of taxpayer money is being allocated. This serves as an excellent means to achieve transparent public governance of resources, addressing a current challenge.

All environments contain information, sometimes structured, sometimes not. In this project, I obtained data from a CEAPS public source in .csv files. While this data is structured, it requires some transformation activities to make it suitable for consumption in business intelligence software, such as Power BI.

After wrangling the data using a Python script, several questions were formulated to provide an initial direction for the study. The primary objective is to derive insights from the dataset, including identifying the senator with the highest expenditure or the one who has been utilizing public resources for the longest duration.
